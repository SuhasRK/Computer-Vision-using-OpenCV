# OCR (Optical Character Recognition) with Paddle OCR

Optical Character Recognition is the technique that recognizes and converts text into a machine-readable format by analyzing and understanding its underlying patterns.

OCR algorithms understand the underlying features of the text and predict the corresponding output for it using Neural networks. OCR can predict the output accurately and that too in a matter of milliseconds.
